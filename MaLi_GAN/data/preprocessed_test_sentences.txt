Quantum

Some
viewed

While

dump

But
P&G
contends
the

is
a
unique
formula

also
offers
an
ingredient
that
prevents
colors

fading

<END>
<START>
And
retailers
are
expected

embrace

Justice
Stevens

is
probably
the

dissenters

Of

Mr.

a
practitioner
of
ethnic
humor
from
the
old
days
on

Belt

live
television

nightclub
circuit
,
Mr.

instinctively
reached
for
the
vernacular

<START>
He
said
Jews
were
``

would
the
water
be
quite

<END>
<START>
It
probably
would

few

distinguish

In

some
of
Mr.

critics
have
implied
that
his
type

itself
a
form
of
racism

For
example

the

People
are

place

<END>
<START>
These
critics
fail
to
distinguish
between
the
type
of
ethnic
humor
that
aims
at
disparaging
another
group
,
such
as
``
Polish
jokes
''
;
and
the
type
that
is
double-edged
,
aiming
inward
as
well
as
outward
.
<END>
<START>
The
latter
typically
is
the
humor
of
the
underdog
,
and
it
was
perfected
by
both
blacks
and
Jews
on
the
minstrel
and
vaudeville
stage
as
a
means
of
mocking
their
white
and
gentile
audiences
along
with
themselves
.
<END>
<START>
In
the
hands
of
a
zealot
like
Lenny
Bruce
,
this
double-edged
blade
could
cut
both
the
self
and
the
audience
to
ribbons
.
<END>
<START>
But
wielded
by
a
pro
like
Jackie
Mason
,
it
is
a
constructive
form
of
mischief

<END>
<START>
Why
constructive
?
<END>
<START>
Because
despite
all
the
media
prattle
about
comedy
and
politics
not
mixing
,
they
are
similar
in
one
respect
:
Both
can
serve
as
mechanisms
for
easing
tensions
and
facilitating
the
co-existence
of
groups
in
conflict

<END>
<START>
That
's
why
it
's
dangerous

well-intentioned

taboo

critical
mention

is

group
conflicts
still
exist

undeniably
they
do
-RRB-

if
Mr.
Mason

type

then
what
other
means
do
we
have
for
letting
off
steam

<END>
<START>
Do
n't
say

that
happens

be
a
genre
that

in

desperate
need
to
attract
everybody

offend
nobody

resembles
politics
more

it
does
comedy

<END>
<START>
It
is
true
that
the
best
sitcoms
do
allow
group
differences
to
simmer

yuppies

blue-collar
Bostonians
in
``
Cheers
''
;
children
vs.
adults
in
``
The

<START>
Back
in
the
1920s
,
the
play
and
movie
versions
of
``
Abie
's
Irish
Rose
''
made
the
theme
of
courtship
between
the
assimilated
offspring
of
Jewish
and
Irish
immigrants
so
popular
that
its
author
,
Anne
Nichols
,
lost
a
plagiarism
suit
on
the
grounds
that
the
plot
has
entered
the
public
domain
.
<END>
<START>
And
it
has
remained
there
,
as
evidenced
by
its
reappearance
in
a
1972
CBS
sitcom
called
``
Bridget
Loves
Bernie
,
''
whose
sole
distinction
was
that
it
led
to
the
real-life
marriage
of
Meredith
Baxter
and
David
Birney
.
<END>
<START>
Clearly
,
the
question
with
``
Chicken
Soup
''
is
not
whether
the
pot
will
boil
over
,
but
whether
it
will
simmer
at
all
.
<END>
<START>
So
far
,
the
bubbles
have
been
few
and
far
between
.
<END>
<START>
Part
of
the
problem
is
the
tendency
of
all
sitcoms
,
ever
since
the
didactic
days
of
Norman
Lear
,
to
preach
about
social
issues
.
<END>
<START>
To
some
extent
,
this
tendency
emerges
whenever
the
show
tries
to
enlighten
us
about
ethnic
stereotypes
by
reversing
them
.
<END>
<START>
For
instance
,
Michael
dislikes
Jackie
not
because
he
's
a
shrewd
Jewish
businessman
,
but
because
he
quits
his
well-paying
job
as
a
salesman
in
order
to
become
a
social
worker
.
<END>
<START>
Even
more
problematic
is
the
incompatibility
between
sitcom
preachiness
and
Mr.
Mason
's
comic
persona
.
<END>
<START>
The
best
moments
in
the
show
occur
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
-LRB-
and
occasionally
in
the
middle
-RRB-
,
when
Mr.
Mason
slips
into
his
standup
mode
and
starts
meting
out
that
old-fashioned
Jewish
mischief
to
other
people
as
well
as
to
himself
.
<END>
<START>
But
too
often
,
these
routines
lack
spark
because
this
sitcom
,
like
all
sitcoms
,
is
timid
about
confronting
Mr.
Mason
's
stock
in
trade
-
ethnic
differences

<END>
<START>
I
'm
not
suggesting
that
the
producers
start
putting
together
episodes
about
topics
like
the
Catholic-Jewish
dispute
over
the
Carmelite
convent
at
Auschwitz

<END>
<START>
That
issue

like
racial

to
cool
down

heat
up

it
can
simmer

<START>
But
I
am
suggesting
that
they
stop
requiring
Mr.
Mason
to
interrupt
his
classic
shtik
with
some
line
about
``
caring

I

who
assert
their
Fifth
Amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
congressional
hearings

<END>

The
Fifth
Amendment
states
in
relevant
part
that
no

``

any
criminal
case

be
a
witness
against

<END>

This
privilege
against
self-incrimination
precludes
the
drawing
of
an
adverse
inference
against
a
criminal
defendant
who
chooses
not
to
testify
.
<END>
<START>
Thus
,
in
a
criminal
case
,
a
prosecutor
can
not
comment
on
a
defendant
's
failure
to
testify
nor
can
the
defendant
be
compelled
to
take
the
stand
as
a
witness

thus
forcing
him
to
``
take
the
Fifth

<END>
<START>
The
privilege
,
however
,
has
been
limited
in

its
plain
language
to
protect
the
defendant

criminal
matters
only

<END>

The
Supreme
Court

he
may
be
forced
to
testify

may
permit

take

Allowing

uncertainty

one

drop

In

the

brought
the
Reagan

Democratic

in
a
two-year
plan

reduce
the

more

both

back
