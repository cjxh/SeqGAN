thus
can
prevent

Such
so-called
male-sterile
plants
can
then
be
fertilized
by
pollen
from
another
strain
of
the
plant
,
thereby
producing
hybrid
seed

high-production
trait

``

similar
to
that
now
seen
in
hybrid
corn
.
<END>
<START>
On
a
commercial
scale
,
the
sterilization
of
the
pollen-producing
male
part
has
only
been
achieved
in
corn
and
sorghum
feed
grains

<END>
<START>
That
's
because
the
male
part
,
the
tassel
,
and
the
female
,
the
ear

are
some
distance
apart
on
the
corn
plant

<END>
<START>
In
a
labor-intensive
process
,
the
seed
companies
cut
off
the
tassels

each
plant

making
it
male
sterile
.
<END>
<START>
They
sow
a
row
of
male-fertile
plants
nearby
,
which
then
pollinate
the
male-sterile
plants
.
<END>
<START>
The
first
hybrid
corn
seeds
produced
using
this
mechanical
approach
were
introduced
in
the
1930s

they
yielded
as
much

20
%
more
corn

naturally
pollinated
plants

Genetic
Systems

isolated
a
pollen-inhibiting
gene
that
can
be
inserted

confer
male
sterility
.
<END>
<START>
The
sterilizing
gene
is
expressed
just
before
the
pollen
is
about
to
develop
and
it
deactivates
the
anthers
of
every
flower
in
the
plant
.

Mr.
Leemans
said
this
genetic
manipulation
does
n't
hurt
the

plant

The
researchers
also
pulled
off
a
second
genetic
engineering
trick
in
order
to
get
male-sterile
plants
in
large
enough
numbers
to
produce
a
commercial
hybrid
seed
crop
.
<END>
<START>
They
attached
a
second
gene
,
for
herbicide
resistance
,
to
the
pollen-inhibiting
gene
.
<END>
<START>
Both
genes
are
then
inserted
into
a
few
greenhouse
plants
,
which
are
then
pollinated
and
allowed
to
mature
and
produce
seed
.
<END>
<START>
The
laws
of
heredity
dictate
that
half
of
the
plants
springing
from
these
greenhouse-produced
seeds
will
be
male
sterile
and
herbicide
resistant
and
half
will
be
male
fertile
and
herbicide
susceptible
.
<END>
<START>
The
application
of
herbicide
would
kill
off
the
male-fertile
plants
,
leaving
a
large
field
of
male-sterile
plants
that
can
be
cross-pollinated
to
produce
hybrid
seed

a
headache

long-term
investors

rates

the
original
mortgage
securities
carried

Compounding
the
trouble
to
Japanese
investors
,
mortgage
securities
pay
interest
monthly
,
since
most
mortgages
require
homeowners
to
make
monthly
payments
.
<END>
<START>
But
Japanese
institutional
investors
are
used
to
quarterly

semiannual
payments
on
their
investments
,
so
the
monthly
cash
flow
posed
administrative
problems

Recent

greater
stock-price
appreciation

corporations
without
poison
pills
during
the
past
few
years

<START>
Critics
of
poison
pills
argue
that
they
harm
shareholders
by
letting
corporate
management
defeat
takeover
bids
at
premium
prices
and
by
deterring
premium
bids
from
ever
being
made
to
shareholders
.
<END>
<START>
These
critics
are
backed
by
several
academic
studies
showing
that
the
adoption
of
poison
pills
reduces
shareholder
values
not
merely
in
the
short
run
,
but
also
over
longer
periods
.
<END>
<START>
Institutional
investors
that
must
evaluate
poison
pills
on
a
regular
basis
are
interested
less
in
this
general
debate
than
in
the
answers
to
specific
questions
about
the
corporation
issuing
the
pill
.
<END>
<START>
Does
this
corporation
have
a
high-quality
management
team
with
a
good
track
record
?
<END>
<START>
Does
this
team
have
a
viable
strategy
for
improving
shareholder
values

and
does
this
strategy
require
implementation
over
an
extended
period
?
<END>
<START>
Will
the
adoption
of
this
particular
form
of
a
poison
pill
significantly
improve
the
chances
for
management
to
carry
out
this
strategy
?
<END>
<START>
If
the
answers
to
these
questions
are
affirmative
,
then
institutional
investors
are
likely
to
be
favorably
disposed
toward
a
specific
poison
pill
.
<END>
<START>
However
,
the
problem
is
that
once
most
poison
pills
are
adopted
,
they
survive
forever

Although
the

team

what
will
be
the
strategy
in

years

<END>
<START>
The
solution
to
this
problem
is
a
time-limited
poison
pill
.
<END>
<START>
The
limit
could
range
from
three
years
to
seven
years
,
depending
on
the
composition
of
the
management
team
and
the
nature
of
its
strategic
plan
.
<END>
<START>
One
rare
example
of
a
time-limited
poison
pill
is
the
shareholder
rights
plan
adopted
by
Pennzoil
last
year

it
received
a
huge
litigation
settlement
from
Texaco

<END>
<START>
Pennzoil

covers
five

to
give
current
management
enough
time
to
put
these
proceeds
to
work
in
a
prudent
manner
.
<END>
<START>
Another
interesting
example
is
the
poison

adopted
recently

Pittsburgh-based
National
Intergroup
Inc.

a
diversified

devise

<START>
This
pill
automatically
expires
after
three
years
unless
continued
by
a
vote
of
the
shareholders

<END>
<START>
More
widespread
time
limits

poison

<END>
<START>
Assume
a
neighborhood
demonstration
to
protest
speeding
on
a
certain
road
or
a
careless
accident
involving
a
police
car
.
<END>
<START>
The
protesters
lie
down
in
the
street
,
blocking
traffic
,
and
will
not
move
until
the
authorities
carry
them
away
.
<END>
<START>
Assume
that
someone
caught

the
jam

a
heart
attack

<END>
<START>
There

no
way

get
an
ambulance
in
quickly
to
move
him
to
a
hospital
.
<END>
<START>
He
dies
.
<END>
<START>
The
demonstration
was
non-violent
and
involved
only
a
simple
misdemeanor
,
but
its
impact
on
that
individual
was
violent
and
terminal
.
<END>
<START>
Assume
that
a
TV
network
is
airing
a
celebrity
interview
program
with
a
live
audience
.
<END>
<START>
The
politician
appearing
is
highly
controversial
and
has
recently
generated
a
good

of
rancor
amid
certain
groups

<END>
<START>
In
a
planned
protest
against
his
appearance
,
several
members
of
the
studio
audience
chain
themselves
in

of
the
TV
cameras
in
such
a
way
that
the
program
can
not
continue
.
<END>
<START>
The
network
must
refund
money
to
the
advertisers
and
loses
considerable
revenue
and
prestige
.
<END>
<START>
The
demonstrators
have
been
non-violent
,
but
the
result
of
their
trespasses
has
been
to
seriously
impair
the
rights
of
others
unconnected
with
their
dispute
.
<END>

the

<START>
Geraldo

<END>
<START>
Let
us
look
for
a
moment
at
another
type
of
non-violent
civil
disobedience
that
only
harms
other
people
indirectly
,
yet
does
irreparable
damage
to
the
nation
as
a
whole
.
<END>
<START>
I
am
referring
to
those
young
men
who
chose

disobey

country

call

arms

Vietnam
war
and
fled
to
Canada

some
other
sanctuary
to
avoid
combat

<END>
<START>
Even
more
at
fault
are
those
leaders
in

out

government
who
urged

supported
their
defections
,
thereby
giving
great
help

comfort
to
the
enemy
propagandists

<START>
It
is
amazing
that
the
ensuing
mass
executions

Vietnam

fine-tuned

Worse

who
fought

died
in
Vietnam

<END>
<START>
Finally
,
I
think
it
important
to
point
out
the
extraordinarily
high
visibility
of
non-violent
civil
disobedience
in
these
days
of
intensive
media
coverage

<END>
<START>

<START>
This
brings
into
question
the
motives
of
those
who
lead
civil

demonstrations

they
want
the
spotlight
for
themselves

for
their
cause

<START>
Here
is
a
good
rule
of
thumb
:
If
the
movement
produced
the
leader
,
the
chance
that
he
is
sincere
is
much
greater
than
if
the
leader
produced
the
movement
.
<END>
<START>
In
either
case
,
ask
yourself
whether
you
have
become
better
informed
on
the
issues
under
protest
by
watching
the
act
of
civil
disobedience
.
<END>
<START>
If
you
have
not
,
it
is
probable
that
a
thorough
airing
of
the
dispute
by
calm

rational
debate
would
have
been
the
better
course

Right

the

Last

it

Because

the

Dark

President

Mr.

the
many
hurdles
the
Soviet

must
leap

he
is
going

succeed

terminated

means

The
story
of
tumor-suppressor
genes
goes
back
to
the
1970s
,
when
a
pediatrician
named
Alfred
G.
Knudson
Jr.
proposed
that
retinoblastoma
stemmed
from
two
separate
genetic
defects
.
<END>
<START>
He
theorized
that
in
the
eye
cancer
,
an
infant
inherited
a
damaged
copy
of
a
gene
from
one
parent
and
a
normal
copy
from
the
other
.
<END>
<START>
The
tumor
,
he
suggested
,
developed
when
the
second
,
normal
copy
also
was
damaged
.
<END>
<START>
But
there
was
no
way
to
prove
Dr.
Knudson
's
``
two-hit
''
theory
.
<END>
<START>
Back
then
,
scientists
had
no
way
of
ferreting
out
specific
genes
,
but
under
a
microscope
they
could
see
the
23
pairs
of
chromosomes
in
the
cells
that
contain
the
genes
.
<END>
<START>
Occasionally
,
gross
chromosome
damage
was
visible
.
<END>
<START>
Dr.
Knudson
found
that
some
children
with
the
eye
cancer
had
inherited
a
damaged
copy
of
chromosome
No.
13
from
a
parent
who
had
had
the
disease
.
<END>
<START>
Under
a
microscope
he
could
actually
see
that
a
bit
of
chromosome
13
was
missing
.
<END>
<START>
He
assumed
the
missing
piece
contained
a
gene
or
genes
whose
loss
had
a
critical
role
in
setting
off
the
cancer
.
<END>
<START>
But
he
did
n't
know
which
gene
or
genes
had
disappeared

Then
,
a
scientific
team
led
by
molecular
geneticist
Webster
Cavenee

then
at

University

found
the
answer

By
analyzing
cells

defects

chromosome

exact
area
as
in
the
first
copy

the
chromosome

The
finding
riveted

It

first

genetic
damage

uncovering
a

genetic

some

others

malignant

many
in
both

cancer
development
emerged

If
both
copies

a

gene

knocked
out

benign
polyps

develop

<START>
If
both
copies
of
a
second
gene
were
then
deleted

the
polyps
would
progress
to
malignancy

<START>
It
was
clear
that
more
than
one
gene
had
to
be
damaged
for
colon
cancer
to
develop
.
<END>
<START>
Their
report
galvanized
other
molecular
biologists
.
<END>
<START>
But
Dr.
Vogelstein
had
yet
to
nail
the
identity
of
the
gene
that
,
if
damaged
,
flipped
a
colon
cell
into
full-blown
malignancy
.
<END>
<START>
They
focused
on
chromosome
17
.
<END>
<START>
Such
a
piece
of
DNA
would
probably
constitute
a
gene

<END>
<START>
When
they
found
it
last
winter

Dr.
Vogelstein
was
dubious
that
the
search
was
over

The
deletion
Dr.
Vogelstein
found
was
in
exactly
the
same
spot
as
p53
.
<END>

But
Mr.
Levine
had
said
the
p53
gene
caused
cancer
by
promoting
growth
,
whereas
the
Johns
Hopkins
scientists
were
looking
for
a
gene
that
suppressed
growth
.
<END>

Evidence
now
is
emerging
that
the
p53
suppressor
gene
is
involved
in
other
cancers
,
too

Researchers

Edinburgh

Scotland

breast
tumors

one
copy

chromosome
17
was
mutated
at
the
spot
where
gene
p53
lies
.

<START>
The
scientists
say
that
since
breast
cancer
often
strikes
multiple
members
of
certain
families

the
gene
,
when
inherited

<START>
To

we

Britain
has

running
largish
budget

In

Keynesian

We
should
also
add
Mr.
Lawson
's
own
explanation
,
as
we
understand
it
.
<END>
<START>
Unlike
the
U.S.
,
Britain
never
achieved
even
a
momentary
reduction
in
real
wages
.
<END>
<START>
The
wage
stickiness
,
which
OECD
studies
confirm
is
particularly
high
in
Britain
,
gives
its
economy
a
structural
bias
toward
inflation
.
<END>
<START>
Inflation
is
easier
to
spark
and
harder
to
control
.
<END>
<START>
We
should
also
concede
that
in
the
British
experience
the
monetarist
cause
regains
some

the
credibility
it
lost
in
the
U.S.
experience

Somewhere

purchasing
power

Mr.

In
fixing
rates
the
choice
of
initial
parities
is
crucial

perhaps
he
picked
the

pound-DM

Mr.
Reynolds
also
notes
that
since
British

have
no

requirements

high
interest
rates
are
less
likely
to
curb
inflation
than
to
cause
recession

Mrs.

In

In

Sir

<END>
<START>
Until
his
resignation

Mr.
Lawson
had
been
conducting
British
monetary
policy
as

the
pound
were
tied
to
the
mark
.
<END>
<START>
When
Mrs.
Thatcher
cut
the
top
tax
rate
to
40
%
,
Mr.
Lawson
flooded
the
country
with
money
to
prevent
the
pound
from
rising
against
the
mark

<END>
<START>
As
a

he
reignited
the
inflation

Mrs.
Thatcher

had
subdued

With
inflation
surging

the

falling

<END>
<START>
To
keep
the
exchange
rate
pegged
,
Mr.
Lawson
tightened
monetary
policy
and
pushed
interest
rates
up
to
15
%
.
<END>
<START>
This
doubled
the
mortgage
interest
rates
of
the
many
new
homeowners
that
Mrs.
Thatcher
's
policies
had
created
,
producing
widespread
disaffection

pushing
Labor
ahead

This

Mrs.

one

appeal

<END>
<START>
If
the

the
British
would
have
been
unable
to
cut
their
exorbitant
tax
rates
.
<END>
<START>
The
reason
is
simple
.
<END>
<START>
When
a
country
cuts
tax
rates
,
it
makes
itself
more
attractive
to
investors
and
drives
up
the
value
of
its
currency
.
<END>
<START>
It
was
fear
of
disturbing
EMS
exchange-rate
relationships
that
caused
the
Chirac
government
in
France
to
be
timid
about
cutting
tax
rates
.
<END>
<START>
The
price
of
attracting
capital
--
whether
one
's
own
or
that
of
foreigners
--
is
a
trade
deficit
.
<END>
<START>
To
avoid
this
deficit
Mr.
Lawson
inflated
the
pound
in
order
to
prevent
its
rise
.
<END>
<START>
This
misguided
policy
could
not
prevent
a
British
trade
deficit
.
<END>
<START>
Consequently
,
Mr.
Lawson
saddled
Mrs.
Thatcher
with
a
record
trade
deficit
,
renewed
inflation
and
high
interest
rates
--
three
political
failures
in
a
row

<END>
<START>
Little
wonder
that
Mrs.
Thatcher
's
opponents
were
so
anxious
to
keep
Mr.
Lawson
in
office

<END>
<START>
It
is
extraordinary
that
the
British
Treasury
thought
it
could
prevent
a
trade
deficit
by
inflating
the
pound
.
<END>
<START>
This
change
in
the
British
capital
account
required
an
offsetting
change
in
the
trade
account
,
a
change
that
could
not
be
prevented

pegging

<END>
<START>
Nigel
Lawson
was
a
victim
of
the
immense
confusion
in
thought
that
has
been
characteristic
of
Western
financial
circles
during
the
1980s
.
<END>
<START>
The
most
important
governments
have
ignored
the
role

low

in
attracting
real
capital
investment

instead
emphasizing
financial

high

In

Kidder

speculation

<END>
<START>
To
answer
the
brokerage
question
,
Kidder
,
in
typical
fashion

completed

study

<END>
<START>
Mr.
Carpenter
notes
that
these
types

investors
also
are
``
sophisticated

enough
not
to
complain
about
Kidder
's
aggressive
use
of
program
trading

<END>
<START>
As
part
of
the
upscale
push
,
Kidder
is
putting
brokers
through
a
20-week
training
course
,
turning
them
into
``
investment
counselors
''
with
knowledge
of
corporate
finance

They
will
get
``
new

investor

''
says
brokerage
chief
Charles
V.
Sheehan
.
<END>
<START>
Theoretically
,
the
brokers
will
then
be
able
to
funnel
``
leads
''
on
corporate
finance
opportunities
to
Kidder
's
investment
bankers
,
possibly
easing
the
longstanding
tension
between
the
two
camps
.
<END>
<START>
However
,
skeptics
caution
that
this
kind
of
cross-pollination
between
brokers
and
investment
bankers
looks
great
on
paper
,
but
does
n't
always
happen
.
<END>
<START>
Kidder
competitors
are

outwardly
hostile

Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.

However

competitors
say

Kidder

hiring
binge

could
backfire

Lawmakers

The

from

In

<START>
At

71%-controlled

the

was
on

Under

Waertsilae
sold

The

guaranteed

Government
officials
were
expected
to

thus

The

the
enactment

this
provision

Also
precluded
would
be
dual

One
of

Federal

Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
has
n't
made

Fed
has
plenty

responsibilities

market
turmoil

In

The

The

intervening

foreign
currency
markets

all
right

at

,
it
appeared
to
be
``
sterilizing
''
the
intervention

In
other
words

it

the

may
do

But
it

He
distinguished

enlivening
the

I

that
three
themes
have
come
together

<START>
The
first
is
that
it
represents
an
intense
battle
in
what
James
Thurber
used
to
caricature
as
``
the
war
between
the
sexes

''
<END>
<START>
But
although
Thurber
did
so
gently
and
lightheartedly
,
many
of
Dr.
Morgan
's
supporters
have
taken
Thurber
's
memorable
title
``
The
Male
Animal
''
quite
literally
.
<END>
<START>
The
vehemence
of
the
emotions
aroused
by
the
case
testifies
to
its
symbolic
importance
in
the
war
that
Thurber
accepted
as
an
eternal
part
of
the
human
condition
.
<END>
<START>
A
second
theme
is
the
undercurrent
of
social
class
and
race
in
the
public
reaction
to
the
Morgan
case
.
<END>
<START>
Dr.
Morgan
is
a
highly
educated
white
professional
who
attended
some
of
the
``
best
''
schools

<END>
<START>
Or
that
the

would
have
hurried
to
sign
the

``
out
of
compassion

her
plight
''
?
<END>
<START>
To
ask
those
questions
is
to
answer
them

<END>
<START>
Finally
,
the
case
of
Dr.
Morgan
gave
Congress
an
opportunity
to
act
with
unaccustomed
decisiveness
and
to
engage
in
one
of
its
favorite
pastimes
--
bashing
the
District
of
Columbia
government

<END>

Bashing
the

ones

he
added
.
<END>
<START>
Circuit
breakers
,
designed

give
the

a
breather

cases

sharp
price
movements

curb
trading

Mr.

Mr.

most

David

The
measure

<START>
But
the
new
chairman
vehemently
opposed
a
provision
in

give
the
agency
the
right

close
the
markets
at
times
of
stress
.

Mr.
Breeden
contended
that
uncertainty

when
the
SEC
might
act
could
worsen
volatility

the
markets

<END>
<START>
He
argued
that
the
current
circuit-breaker
system
allows
investors
to
know
``
precisely

any
trading
interruptions
will
occur

how
long
they

the
SEC
detailed
information

made
by
their
holding
companies

<END>
<START>
Such
loans
often
are
used
to
finance
leveraged
buy-outs

the
agency
is
worried
that
a
sharp
market
drop
could
create
capital
problems
for
the
firms

also
backed
a
rule

require
large

report
transactions

systematic
basis

information

the

Mr.
Corry

With

the
``

guidelines

They
strongly
suggest
that
Justice
's
prosecutions
of
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
,
Michael
Milken
and
Princeton/Newport
violated
notions
of
fundamental
fairness
.
<END>
<START>
Justice
is
attempting
to
avoid
a
replay
of
these
tactics

This
amounts
to
an
extraordinary
repudiation
of
the
tenure
of
New

mayoral
candidate
and
former
U.S.
Attorney
Rudolph
Giuliani
,
who
was
more
inclined
to
gathering
scalps
than
understanding
markets

The
new
guidelines
limit
the
pretrial
forfeitures
of
assets
of
RICOed
defendants
and
their
investors
,
clients
,
bankers
and
others
.
<END>
<START>
This
follows
earlier
new
guidelines
from
the
Tax
Division
prohibiting
Princeton/Newport-like
tax
cases
from
masquerading
as
RICO
cases
.
<END>
<START>
The
forfeiture
memo
cited
``
considerable
criticism
in
the
press
,
because
of
a
perception
that
pre-trial
freezing

is
tantamount
to
a
seizure
of
property
without
due
process

<END>
<START>
These
changes
come
a
tad
late

Princeton/Newport
,
the
first
RICOed
securities
firm

<START>
It
was
forced
into
liquidation

trial

investors
yanked
their

the

demanded
a
huge
pre-trial
asset
forfeiture

<START>
Prosecutors
wanted
$
23.8
million
in
forfeiture
for
alleged
tax
fraud
of
some
$
400,000
.
<END>
<START>
The
experience
of
Princeton/Newport
and
initiation
of
other
RICO-forfeiture
cases
against
legitimate
businesses
taught
Drexel
that
a
RICOed
investment
bank
would
be
an
ex-investment
bank
.
<END>
<START>
Drexel
therefore
agreed
instead
to
an
arrangement
allowing
it
to
plea
to
charges
``
which
the
company
is
not
in
a
position
to
dispute
''
because
of
RICO
.
<END>

Part
of
Drexel
's
plea
was
to
cut
Mr.
Milken
loose

So
after
all
the
prosecutorial
hoopla
no
one
has
established
what

anything
,
Drexel
did
wrong
.
<END>
<START>
So
two
cheers
for
the
new
rules
.
<END>
<START>
But
prosecutorial
guidelines
are
effective
only
if
someone
at
Justice
is
willing
and
able
to
supervise
hyperactive
prosecutors
.
<END>
<START>
No
prosecutorial
guidelines

observed

unobserved

limit
civil
RICO
cases

plaintiffs

damages

What
now

Princeton/Newport
officials

Drexel

Mr.
Milken

Justice
should
review
these
cases
to
see
what
other
prosecutorial
abuses
may
have
occurred
.
<END>
<START>
We
suspect
that
Justice
will
some

agree
that
only
the
complete
repeal

can
guarantee
an
end

injustices

The

called
the
Burgess

The

animals

be
simple
in
design

limited

ancestral

contemporary

Accordingly

the
hidebound
traditionalist
reconstructed
hypothetical
organisms

the
Burgess
fossils

they
could
be
shoehorned
into
familiar

It

not
until
the

Cambridge
Prof.

A

the
frequent
jokes
festooning

Interest

Not
long

the
appearance

there
was
an
explosive
proliferation

animal

seen
on

The

Back

However

Under

countries

doled
it

produce

higher
official

The
main
effect

some
of
the
overproduction
already

the
quota
cheaters

But
the
concept

disproportionate
quotas

advanced
there

was
generally
endorsed
by

The

worth
somewhere
between
$
135

That

As

a

amounts

One
of

was

Richard
A.
Oriani
,
professor
of
chemical
engineering
at
the
University

Minnesota

<END>
<START>
Mr.
Oriani
said
his
skepticism
of
the

was
initially
confirmed
when
his
first
experiments
last
spring
failed
to
produce
results

<END>
<START>
But
he
then
borrowed
a
palladium
rod

chemists

Texas
A&M
who
said
they
were
getting
excess
heat

<END>
<START>
``
The

he
said

On

borrowed
rod
,
the
experiment
began
producing
excess

The

stopped

change

<END>
<START>
When
it
was
restarted
,
heat
output
``
really
took
off
''
and
produced
excess
heat
for
several
hours
before
dying
down
,
he
said
.
<END>
<START>
Typical
of
other
experiments
,
Mr.
Oriani
said
his
experiment
was
``
very
erratic
.
''
<END>
<START>
The
excess
heat
was
15
%
to
20
%
more
than
the
energy
involved
in
the
electrolysis
of
water
.
<END>
<START>
``
There
is
a
reality

scientists
said
they
also
were
getting
sporadic
bursts
of
excess

<END>
<START>
One
chemist
privately
suggested
this
hinted
that
some
``
anomalous
''
chemical
reactions
might
be
producing
the
heat
.
<END>
<START>
One
reason
questions
surround
the
heat
experiments
is
that
they
involve
unusually
meticulous
measurements
.
<END>
<START>
Typically
,
the
input
energy
ranges
from
a
third
of
a
watt
to
one
watt
and
the
excess
energy
is
measured
in
tenths
of
a
watt
.
<END>
<START>
One
exception
is
a
continuing
experiment
at
Stanford
University
where
as
much
as
10
watts
of
energy
are
being
put
into
the
electrolytic
cells
.
<END>
<START>
One
of
the
few
hints
the
excess
heat
might
be
produced
by
fusion
came
from
brief
remarks
by
chemist
John
Bockris
of
Texas
A&M
University
.
<END>
<START>
Mr.
Bockris
previously
reported
getting
bursts
of
excess
heat
and
of
detecting
increasing
amounts
of
tritium
forming
in
the
heavy
water
.
<END>
<START>
Increasingly
careful
attempts
to
measure
neutrons
,
which
would
be
strong
evidence
of
fusion
reactions
,
continue
to
be
negative
.
<END>
<START>
Messrs.
Fleischmann
and
Pons
initially
reported
indirect
evidence
of
neutrons
being
produced
in
their
experiment
but
later
conceded
the
measurements
were
questionable
.
<END>
<START>
In
subsequent
experiments
,
one
of
two
neutron
detectors
occasionally
indicated
a
burst
of
neutrons
but
neutron
bursts
were
never
recorded
in
both
detectors
at
the
same
time
.
<END>
<START>
They
concluded
the
indications
of
neutrons
stemmed
from
faults
in
the
detectors
rather
than
from
the
cold
fusion
experiment

The

that

relying
heavily
on
imported

<END>
<START>
That
trend
could
increase
demand

hot-dipped
galvanized
sheet

<END>
<START>
Indeed
,
USX
said
it
expects
the

steel

reach
12

10.2

<END>
<START>
USX
already
has
six
lines

existing

hot-dipped

this
marks
the
first
so-called
greenfield
plant

Moreover

it

USX

current
hot-dipped
capacity

1,275,000

<START>
The
company

it

capacity

adversely
affect
the
company

existing
hot-dipped
galvanizing
lines

Steelmakers
have
also
been
adding
capacity

so-called
electrogalvanized
steel

another
way
to
make
coated
corrosion-resistant
steel

<END>
<START>
One
of
the
advantages

the
hot-dipped

ONCE
YOU

So
here
's
a
rundown
of
the
most
common
types
of
market
orders
permitted
by
the
stock
and
commodity
exchanges
.
<END>
<START>
Two
things
to
keep
in
mind
:
Not
all
exchanges
accept
every
type
of
order
.
<END>
<START>
And
even
when
a
specific
order
is
acceptable
to
an
exchange
,
a
brokerage
firm
can
refuse
to
enter
it
for
a
customer
.
<END>
<START>
Market
Order
:
This
is
probably
the
most
widely
used
order
--
and
the
one
most
open
to
abuse
by
unscrupulous
floor
brokers
,
since
it
imposes
no
price
restrictions
.
<END>
<START>
With
a
market
order
,
an
investor
tells
a
broker
to
buy
or
sell
``
at
the
market
.
''
<END>
<START>
It
's
like
saying
,
``
get
me
in
now
''
or
``
get
me
out
now
.
''
<END>
<START>
A
recent
indictment
alleges
that
some
floor
brokers
at
the
two
largest
Chicago
commodity
exchanges
used
market
orders
to
fill
customers
'
orders
at
unfavorable
prices
by
arranging
trades
with
fellow
brokers
.
<END>
<START>
Profits
realized
from
these
trades
would
then
be
shared
by
the
conspiring
brokers
.
<END>
<START>
Limit
Order
:
Limit
orders
are
used
when
investors
want
to
restrict
the
amount
they
will
receive
or
pay
for
an
investment
.
<END>
<START>
Investors
do
this
by
specifying
a
minimum
price
at
which
the
investment
may
be
sold
or
the
maximum
price
that
may
be
paid
for
it
.
<END>
<START>
Suppose
an
investor
wants
to
sell
a
stock
,
but
not
for
less
than
$
55
.
<END>
<START>
A
limit
order
to
sell
could
be
entered
at
that
price
.
<END>
<START>
One
risk
:
Investors
may
regret
the
restriction
if
the
stock
reaches
54
and
then
falls
.
<END>
<START>
Stop
Order
:
Stop
orders
tell
a
floor
broker
to
buy
or
sell
an
investment
once
the
price
reaches
a
certain
level
.
<END>
<START>
Once
the
price
reaches
that
level
,
a
stop
order
turns
into
a
market
order
,
and
the
order
is
filled
at
whatever
price
the
broker
can
get
.
<END>
<START>
Stop
orders
are
sometimes
called
``
stop-loss
''
orders
because
they
are
frequently
used
to
protect
profits
or
limit
losses
.
<END>
<START>
While
stop
orders
sound
similar
to
limit
orders
,
there
is
a
difference
:
Sell
stops
must
be
entered
at
a
price
below
the
current
market
price
and
buy
stops
above
.
<END>
<START>
In
contrast
,
sell
limit
orders
must
be
placed
above
the
market
price
and
buy
limit
orders
are
placed
below
.
<END>
<START>
The
crash
in
October
1987
and
last
Friday
's
sell-off
painfully
taught
some
investors
exactly
what
stop
orders
will
and
wo
n't
do
.
<END>
<START>
Stop-Limit
Order
:
Stop-limit
orders
turn
into
limit
orders
when
an
investment
trades
at
the
price
specified
in
the
order
.
<END>
<START>
Unlike
stop
orders
--
which
are
filled
at
the
market
price
when
the
stop
price
is
hit
--
stop-limit
orders
demand
that
the
trades
be
made
only
at
the
specified
price
.
<END>
<START>
If
it
ca
n't
be
made
at
that
price
,
it
does
n't
get
filled
.
<END>
<START>
But
if
the
market
moves
quickly
enough
,
it
may
be
impossible
for
the
broker
to
carry
out
the
order
because
the
investment
has
passed
the
specified
price
.
<END>
<START>
Market-If-Touched
Order
:
Market-if-touched
orders
are
like
stop
orders
in
that
they
become
market
orders
if
a
specified
price
is
reached
.
<END>
<START>
As
soon
as
the
market
trades
at
the
specified
price
the
floor
broker
will
fill
it
at
the
best
possible
price
.
<END>
<START>
Fill-Or-Kill
Order
:
The
fill-or-kill
order
is
one
of
several
associated
with
the
timing
of
trades
.
<END>
<START>
It
instructs
a
broker
to
buy
or
sell
an
investment
at
the
specified
price
or
better
.
<END>
<START>
But
if
the
investment
ca
n't
be
bought
or
sold
immediately
,
the
order
is
automatically
canceled

IN
SIZING
UP
the
risks
of
stock-market
investments
,
there
's
probably
no
starting
place
better
than
``
beta
.
''
<END>
<START>
But
investors
better
not
ignore
its
limitations
,
either
.
<END>
<START>
Beta
is
a
handy
gauge
that
measures
the
volatility
of
a
stock
or
stock
mutual
fund
.
<END>
<START>
For
any
given
move
in
the
overall
market
,
it
suggests
how
steeply
that
particular
issue
might
rise
or
fall
.
<END>
<START>
Beta
figures
are
widely
available
and
easy
to
interpret
.
<END>
<START>
The
beta
of
the
broad
market
,
typically
defined
as
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
,
is
always
1.0
.
<END>
<START>
So
a
stock
with
a
beta
of
0.5
is
half
as
volatile
,
one
at
1.5
is
50
%
more
volatile
,
and
so
on
.
<END>
<START>
Cautious
investors
should
generally
go
with
stocks
that
have
low
betas
.
<END>
<START>
Go
with
high-beta
stocks
to
get
the
biggest
payoff
from
a
bet
on
a
bull
market

Remember
,
though
,
that
beta
also
has
important
limitations

Beta

emeritus
professor
who
developed
the
measure
.
<END>
<START>
``
There
is
risk
that
is
not
associated
with
market
moves

and
the
beta
does
n't
tell
you
the
magnitude

that
.
''
<END>
<START>
In
particular
,
beta
does
n't
measure
the
company

and
industry-specific
risk
associated
with
an
individual
stock

<END>
<START>
That
``
business
''
risk
is
very
significant
for
an
investor
with
only
a
few
stocks
,
but
it
virtually
disappears
in
a
large
and
well-diversified
portfolio
.
<END>
<START>
Beta
is
also
a
poor
indicator
of
the
risk
in
stock
groups
that
march
to
their
own
drummer
.
<END>
<START>
In
particular
,
the
prices
of
gold
and
other
precious-metals
stocks
shoot
up

down

the
stocks
tend
to
have
low
betas
because
their
moves
are
not
market-inspired
.
<END>
<START>
Concern
that
investors
could
misinterpret
such
readings
led
the
American
Association
of
Individual
Investors

beta
figures

When

But
therein
lies
another
aspect
of
investment
risk

the
hazard

shaping
your

to
avoid
one

more
types
of
risk
and
being
blind-sided
by
others

This

your
money

risk-free

<END>
<START>
Risk
wears
many
disguises
,
and
investments
that
are
low

type

obvious
risk
can
be
distressingly
high
in
other

less
obvious
kinds

their
value
as

purchasing
power

fixed-dollar
interest

<END>
<START>
Risk
is
also
a
function
of
time
.
<END>
<START>
When
financial
professionals
measure
risk
mathematically
,
they
usually
focus
on
the
volatility
of
short-term
returns
.
<END>
<START>
Stocks
are
much
riskier
than
Treasury
bills
,
for
example
,
because
the
range
in
performance
from
the
best
years
to
the
worst
is
much
wider
.
<END>
<START>
That
is
usually
measured
by
the
standard
deviation
,
or
divergence
,
of
annual
results
from
the
average
return
over
time

<END>
<START>
But
investors
who
are
preoccupied
with
short-term
fluctuations
may
be
paying
too
little
attention
to
another
big
risk

not
generating
enough
money

meet
long-term
financial

goals

two
hypothetical
families
,
one
a
couple
at
retirement
age

another
a
two-income
couple
at
age
45

illustrate
several
types
of
risk
that
investors
need
to
consider
.
<END>
<START>
For
instance
,
the
insured
municipal
bonds
that
dominate
the
older
couple
's
portfolio
were
probably
selected
in
large
part
for
their
low
repayment
risk
.
<END>
<START>
But
they
expose
the
holders
to
a
lot
of
inflation
risk
and
interest-rate
risk
.
<END>
<START>
The
younger
couple
's
stockholdings
involve
more
risk
than
a
diversified
stock
portfolio
because
the
bulk
of
the
money
is
in
a
single
issue

largely
reflects
the
heavy
stockholdings

one
price
paid
for
the
higher
expected
return
is
greater
short-term
volatility

reflected

the
higher
standard
deviation
that
Seidman
estimates
for
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
.
<END>
<START>
-LRB-
Here
's
how
to
interpret
a
standard
deviation
figure
:
Take
the
expected
return
and
add
one
standard
deviation
to
it
.
<END>
<START>
Then
take
the
expected
return
and
subtract
one
standard
deviation
.
<END>
<START>
In
two

three
years
,
the
actual
result
should
fall
within
that
range
if
all
the
assumptions
were
accurate
.
<END>
<START>
Then
add
and
subtract
two
standard
deviations
to
get
a
wider
range
.
<END>
<START>
There
's
a
95
%
probability
any
year
's
result
will
fall
in
the
range
.
-RRB-
<END>
<START>
Of
course
,
the
greater
volatility
of
the
younger
couple
's
portfolio
does
n't
necessarily
mean
those
investments
are
riskier
in
terms
of
meeting
the
holders
'
long-term
goals
.
<END>
<START>
Indeed
,
the
older
couple
's
portfolio
could
actually
be
riskier
in
that
sense
if
the
expected
return
wo
n't
generate
enough
dollars
to
meet
their
spending
plans

But
sooner

most

have
to
think
about
life

just
as
we
often
have
to
think
about
having
root-canal
work

<END>
<START>
And
my
time
has
come
.
<END>
<START>
I
'm
33
,
married
,
no
children
,
and
employed
in
writing
stories
like
this
one
.
<END>
<START>
In
times
past
,
life-insurance
salesmen
targeted
heads
of
household
,
meaning
men
,
but
ours
is
a
two-income
family
and
accustomed
to
it
.
<END>
<START>
What
to
do
?
<END>
<START>
First
,
generalize
.
<END>
<START>
If
all
you
want
is
death-benefit
coverage
,
pure
insurance
--
a
term
policy
--
gives
you
maximum
bang
for
your
buck
,
within
limits
.
<END>
<START>
It
's
much
cheaper
than
permanent
insurance
bought
at
the
same
age
.
<END>
<START>
But
``
term
''
means
just
that
;
the
policy
is
written
for
a
specific
time
period
only
and
must
be
renewed
when
it
expires
.
<END>
<START>
Even
if
you
're
healthy
and
can
renew
,
your
premium
will
go
up
sharply
because
you
're
that
much
older
.
<END>
<START>
So
term
insurance
may
not
be
as
cheap
as
it
looks
.
<END>
<START>
There
are
all
sorts
of
variations
on
term
insurance
:
policies
structured
to
pay
off
your
mortgage
debt
,
term
riders
tacked
on
to
permanent
insurance
,
and
many
others
.
<END>
<START>
Upon
examination
,
however
,
I
wondered
whether
the
plan
made
a
lot
of
sense
.
<END>
<START>
Sounds
great
--
or
does
it
?
<END>
<START>
First
,
if
I
canceled
,
I
'd
have
no
more
insurance
,
a
not
insignificant
consideration
.
<END>
<START>
That
would
be
all
right
with
Amex
,
which
could
then
lock
in
its
investment
profit
,
but
it
does
n't
add
up
to
a
``
smart
money
''
move
for
me
.
<END>
<START>
Which
goes
to
show
that
the
First
Law
applies
in
insurance
as
in
anything
else
:
There
is
no
free
lunch
,
there
is
only
marketing
.
<END>
<START>
And
the
Second
Law
,
unique
to
insurance
?
<END>
<START>
If
I
die
early
,
I
win
--
a
hollow
victory
,
since
I
ca
n't
enjoy
it
--
and
if
I
live
long
,
the
insurer
wins
.
<END>
<START>
Always
.
<END>
<START>
This
is
worth
remembering
when
insurers
and
their
salesmen
try
to
sell
you
permanent
insurance
,
the
kind
that
amasses
cash
value
.
<END>
<START>
The
implication
is
that
your
permanent-insurance
policy
is
really
some
kind
of
CD
or
mutual-fund
account
with
an
added
feature
.
<END>
<START>
That
is
gilding
the
lily
.
<END>
<START>
That
's
because
you
have
to
pay
for
the
insurance
portion
of
the
policy
and
the
effort
required
to
sell
and
service
the
whole
package
.
<END>
<START>
Again
,
no
free
lunch
.
<END>
<START>
So
view
permanent
insurance
for
what
it
is
--
a
compromise
between
pure
insurance
and
direct
investment
.
<END>
<START>
The
simplest
,
most
traditional
form
of
permanent
insurance
is
the
straight
whole
life
policy
.
<END>
<START>
Congress
closed
this
loophole
last
year
,
or
thought
it
did
.
<END>
<START>
But
the
percentage
of
your
cash
reserve
that
you
can
borrow
tax-free
is
very
small
.
<END>
<START>
I
'm
not
prepared
in
any
case
to
put
that
much
money
into
a
policy
immediately
,
so
I
look
into
the
broad
category
called
universal
life
.
<END>
<START>
Hugely
popular
,
it
is
far
more
flexible
than
straight
whole
life
.
<END>
<START>
Projecting
the
latter
over
several
decades
,
I
find
my
cash
buildup
is
impressive
--
but
can
any
high
interest
rate
prevail
for
that
long
?
<END>
<START>
Not
likely
,
I
think
.
<END>
<START>
Also
,
some
policy
illustrations
assume
that
mortality
costs
will
decline
or
that
I
will
get
some
sort
of
dividend
bonus
after
the
10th
year
.
<END>
<START>
These
are
not
certain
,
either
.
<END>
<START>
There
are
seemingly
endless
twists
to
universal
life
,
and
it
pays
to
ask
questions
about
all
of
them
.
<END>
<START>
I
call
her
agent
,
David
Dominici
.
<END>
<START>
If
interest
rates
plunge
,
the
insurer
may
be
knocking
on
my
door
,
asking
for
steeper
premium
payments
to
maintain
the
same
amount
of
protection
.
<END>
<START>
I
do
n't
like
the
sound
of
that
.
<END>
<START>
Some
insurers
have
also
started
offering
``
persistency
bonuses
,
''
such
as
extra
dividends
or
a
marginally
higher
interest
yield
,
if
the
policy
is
maintained
for
10
years
.
<END>
<START>
But
Glenn
Daily
,
a
New
York-based
financial
consultant
,
warns
that
many
of
these
bonuses
are
``
just
fantasies
,
''
because
most
are
n't
guaranteed
by
the
companies
.
<END>
<START>
And
the
feature
is
so
new
,
he
adds
,
that
no
insurer
has
yet
established
a
track
record
for
actually
making
such
payments
.
<END>
<START>
So-called
living-benefits
provisions
also
merit
a
close
inspection
.
<END>
<START>
Also
,
financial
planners
advising
on
insurance
say
that
to
their
knowledge
there
has
not
yet
been
a
tax
ruling
exempting
these
advance
payments
from
taxes
.
<END>

I

favorably
impressed

reason
is
simple
,
Mr.
Wyss
says
:
``
Interest
rates
almost
always
decline
during
recession
.
''
<END>
<START>
As
surely
as
a
seesaw
tilts
,
falling
interest
rates
force
up
the
price
of
previously
issued
bonds
.
<END>
<START>
They
are
worth
more
because
they
pay
higher
interest
than
newly
issued
bonds
do
.
<END>
<START>
That
effect
holds
true
for
both
short-term
and
long-term
bonds
.
<END>
<START>
But
short-term
bonds
ca
n't
rise
too
much
,
because
everyone
knows
they
will
be
redeemed
at
a
preset
price
fairly
soon
.
<END>
<START>
Long-term
bonds
,
with
many
years
left
before
maturity
,
swing
more
widely
in
price

<END>
<START>
But
not
just
any
bonds
will
do

<END>
<START>
Corporate
bonds
``
are
usually
not
a
good
bet
in
a
recession

''
Mr.
Wyss
says

<END>
<START>
As
times
get
tougher
,
investors
fret
about
whether
companies
will
have
enough
money
to
pay
their
debts
.
<END>
<START>
This
hurts
the
price
of
corporate
bonds
.
<END>
<START>
Also
,
he
notes
,
``
most
corporate
bonds
are
callable
.
''
<END>
<START>
When
interest
rates
have
dropped
,
it
makes
sense
for
corporations
to
do
just
that
;
they
then
save
on
interest
costs
.
<END>
<START>
But
the
investors
are
left
stranded
with
money
to
reinvest
at
a
time
when
interest
rates
are
puny
.
<END>
<START>
If
corporate
bonds
are
bad
in
recessions
,
junk
bonds
are
likely
to
be
the
worst
of
all

<END>
<START>
It
's
an
``
absolute
necessity
''
to
get
out
of
junk
bonds

a

Avner
Arbel
,
professor
of
finance

Cornell
University

``
Such

<END>
<START>
Municipal
bonds
are
generally
a

safer

corporate
bonds
in
a
recession

but
not
as
safe
as
bonds
issued
by
the
federal
government

<END>
<START>
During
an
economic
slump

local
tax
revenues
often
go
down

raising
the
risks
associated
with
at

some
municipals
.
<END>
<START>
And
,
like
corporates
,
many
municipal
bonds
are
callable

<END>
<START>
But
a
few
experts
,
going
against
the
consensus
,
do
n't
think
bonds
would
help
investors
even
if
a
recession
is
in
the
offing

<END>
<START>
What
's
more
,
he
thinks
this
could
be

``
should
be
cautious

''
holding
fewer
stocks
than
usual

also
shunning
bonds

Because
he
sees
a
``
5

For

plan

gain
from
the
sale
of
a
capital
asset

exclusion

it

a
maximum

The
exclusion

Enthusiasts

Consider

four-year

That

outperforming

Another

The

Evaluating
asset-backed
securities
poses
another
problem

Investors
,
for

may
mistakenly

the
bank

originally

guaranteeing
the

It
is

In

if
there

do

expect
Citibank

<END>
<START>
The
prospectus
also
notes
that
the
securities

not
guaranteed

any
government
agency

<START>
That

Take
the
``

letter

Details

credit
enhancements

Still

they
play
a
crucial
role

asset-backed

which
in

is
why
the
yield

slim

skeptics
ask

When

unexpected
difficulties

Underwriters

these

credit
enhancements

some

still

wreak
havoc

At

Americans

asset-backed

taking

heady
gamble

consumers
will
be
able
to
repay
loans
in
hard
times

<END>
<START>
At
the
very
least

a
recession

prompt
investors
to
buy
the
highest-quality
bonds
they
can
find

that

Treasurys

That
could
widen

In

The
theory
relies
on
three
assumptions
:
<END>
<START>
3
-RRB-
Republican
congressional
representatives
,
because
of
their
belief
in
a
minimalist
state
,
are
less
willing
to
engage
in
local
benefit-seeking
than
are
Democratic
members
of
Congress
.
<END>
<START>
Each
legislator
,
after
all
,
is
only
one
out
of
535
when
it
comes
to
national
policy
making
.
<END>
<START>
In
races
for
the
White
House
,
a
voter
's
incentive
,
at
the
margin
,
is
to
lean
Republican
.
<END>
<START>
The
individual
voter
's
standing
consequently
will
be
enhanced
through
lower
taxes
.
<END>
<START>
While
this
theory
is
exceedingly
simple
,
it
appears
to
explain
several
things
.
<END>
<START>
Third
,
the
theory
suggests
why
legislators
who
pay
too
much
attention
to
national
policy
making
relative
to
local
benefit-seeking
have
lower
security
in
office
.
<END>
<START>
For
example
,
first-term
members
of
the
House
,
once
the
most
vulnerable
of
incumbents
,
have
become
virtually
immune
to
defeat
.
<END>
<START>
The
one
exception
to
this
recent
trend
was
the
defeat
of
13
of
the
52
freshman
Republicans
brought
into
office
in
1980
by
the
Reagan
revolution
and
running
for
re-election
in
1982
.
<END>
<START>
Because
these
freshmen
placed
far
more
emphasis
on
their
partisan
role
--
spreading
the
Reagan
revolution
--
in
national
policy
making
,
they
were
more
vulnerable
to
defeat
.
<END>
<START>
Fourth
,
the
theory
indicates
why
the
Republican
Party
may
have
a
difficult
time
attracting
viable
candidates
for
congressional
office
.
<END>
<START>
Potential
candidates
may
be
discouraged
from
running
less
by
the
congressional
salary
than
by
the
prospect
of
defeat
at
the
hands
of
a
Democratic
opponent
.
<END>
<START>
Fifth
,
the
theory
may
provide
at
least
a
partial
reason
for
why
ticket
splitting
has
been
particularly
pronounced
in
the
South
.
<END>
<START>
Finally
,
the
theory
suggests
why
Republicans
generally
have
fared
better
in
Senate
races
than
in
campaigns
for
the
House
.
<END>
<START>
Is
there
any
empirical
support
for
this
theory
?
<END>
<START>
Three
pieces
of
evidence
corroborate
the
key
assumption
that
Democratic
legislators
are
more
willing
to
engage
in
local
benefit-seeking
than
their
Republican
colleagues
.
<END>
<START>
First
,
economists
James
Bennett
and
Thomas
DiLorenzo
find
that
GOP
senators
turn
back
roughly
10
%
more
of
their
allocated
personal
staff
budgets
than
Democrats
do
.
<END>
<START>
To
the
extent
that
the
primary
duty
of
personal
staff
involves
local
benefit-seeking
,
this
indicates
that
political
philosophy
leads
congressional
Republicans
to
pay
less
attention
to
narrow
constituent
concerns
.
<END>
<START>
This
is
indeed
what
the
data
indicate
,
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
House
.
<END>
<START>
The
Democratic
House
attendance
rate

Put
more
simply
,
GOP
candidates
for
president
are

kindly

voters
than
Republican
candidates
for
the
Senate
when
the
prisoner

dilemma

more
severe

<END>
<START>
Moreover
,
ticket
splitting

pattern

government
level

it
does
at
the
federal
level

part

threat

The
stepped-up
administration
warnings
annoyed

senior

the

he
had
authority

block
buy-outs
in
advance

But
he
never
took
an
official
position

bill

has
steadfastly
maintained
that
he
already
has
enough
authority
to
deal
with
buy-outs

<END>
<START>
Although
the
legislation
would
apply
to
any
acquisition
of
a

airline

it
is
aimed
at
transactions
financed
by
large
amounts
of
debt

Supporters
of
the
bill
are
concerned
an
airline
might
sacrifice
costly
safety
measures

to
repay
debt

<START>
The
panel
's
action
occurs
in

recent
buy-out
proposals

volatile
conditions

Currently

the
Transportation
Department
does

<START>
However
,
if
the
secretary
concludes
that
a
transaction
has
made
a
carrier
unfit
to
operate
,
the
department
may
revoke
its
certificate
,
grounding
the
airline
.
<END>
<START>
Such
authority
is
more
than
adequate
,
say
opponents
of
the
legislation

<END>

But
supporters
argue
that
grounding
an
airline
is
so
drastic
that
the
department
would
hesitate
doing
it

voted
down

much

At

the
deductibility

certain
junk
bonds

most
LBOs

<START>
Such
high-yield
debt
is
similar
to
a

it

sold

discount

face
value
,
with
interest
accruing
instead
of
being
paid
to
the
holder

<END>
<START>
Under
current
rules
,
that
accrued
interest
is
deductible
by
the
company
issuing
the
debt
.
<END>
<START>
The
House
version
of
the
legislation
would
kill
that
deduction

and
label
any
such
debt
as
equity
,
which
is
n't
deductible

``
You

Lehman

<START>
``
It

it

n't
have
to
repay
the
debt
for
several
years

<START>
Typically
,
Mr.
Willens
estimates

this

makes
up
15

20

financing

Another
solution
,
said
a
tax
lawyer
who
requested
anonymity

is
for
firms

convertible
bonds

sell

a
discount

<END>
<START>
Since
they
have
a
lower
interest
rate
,
they
would
n't
fall
under
the
junk-bond
category
that
would
lose
its
deductibility
.
<END>
<START>
The
bill
would
then
declare
that
the
debt
is
equity
and
therefore
is
n't
deductible

The
Senate
bill
would
only
deny
the
deduction

interest
is
actually
paid

Currently

even
though
the
issuer
does
n't
pay
tax

the
debt
holder
is
taxed

the
accrued
interest
.

<START>
But
those
holders
are
often
foreign
investors

tax-exempt
pension

do
n't
pay
taxes

As

him

the

done
a
pretty

job

<END>
<START>
They
tried

put
Mr.
Maynard
out
of
business
by
an
act
of
Congress
.
<END>
<START>
Egg-industry
lobbying
helped
persuade
six
states
to
ban
Mr.
Maynard
's
automatic
egg-breaking
machine
because
of
fears
over
salmonella
.
<END>
<START>
His
company
,
Misa
Manufacturing
Inc.
,
was
forced
to
seek
protection
from
creditors
under
federal
bankruptcy
law
in
1987
and
has
since
been
liquidated

<END>
<START>
Mr.
Maynard
is
n't
the
first
entrepreneur
to
bump
up
against
entrenched
interests
.
<END>
<START>
Now
one
might
ask
why
people
who
sell
eggs
would
fight
someone
who
is
trying
to
make
it
easier
to
crack
them
.
<END>
<START>
Part
of
the
answer
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
industry
.
<END>
<START>
Many
larger
egg
producers
are
also
egg
processors
,
who
crack
,
inspect
,
and
sanitize
billions
of
eggs
,
turning
them
into
powdered
,
liquified
or
frozen
egg
products
.
<END>
<START>
But
for
companies
that
use
hundreds
of
eggs
a
day
,
breaking
them
by
hand
can
get
,
well
,
out
of
hand
.
<END>
<START>
One
Egg
King
--
which
at
just
under
four
feet
tall
and
two
feet
wide
has
been
likened
to
the
robot
R2-D2
--
can
crack
about
20,000
eggs
an
hour
.
<END>
<START>
Because
fresh
eggs
are
less
expensive
than
processed
ones
,
a
big
egg
user
can
recover
the
Egg
King
's
$
3,390
cost
in
a
few
months

says
Mr.
Maynard
.
<END>
<START>
Such
centrifugal
egg
breakers
have
been
around
since
the
1890s
.
<END>
<START>
But
when
Mr.
Maynard
came
forward
with
his
machine
in
the
early
1970s
nobody
else
was
offering
them
in
the
U.S.

<END>
<START>
The
main
reason
:
salmonella

<END>
<START>
Chickens
carry
this
bacteria

which
can
cause
upset
stomachs
and
,
in
rare
cases
,
death
among
people
.
<END>
<START>
Hens
sometimes
pass
salmonella
to
the
eggs
,
and
it
can
also
be
found
on
unclean
shells
.
<END>
<START>
Thus
,
any
machine
that
breaks
large
amounts
of
eggs
at
once
has
the
potential
to
spread
salmonella
if
a
bad
egg
gets
in
with
the
good
ones
.
<END>
<START>
Mr.
Maynard
claims
this
is
a
manageable
problem
.
<END>
<START>
With
nearly
4,000
machines
in
use
,
there
have
been
no
salmonella
problems
as
long
as
instructions
were
followed
,
Mr.
Maynard
boasts
.
<END>
<START>
He
says
the
handful
of
salmonella
cases
involving
products
that
may
have
used
eggs
broken
by
an
Egg
King
stemmed
from
a
failure
to
adequately
cook
the
products
.
<END>
<START>
But
he
says
that
's
no

bad

egg-processing
facilities
regulated
by
the
USDA
's
Food
Safety
Inspection
Service

<START>
Unfortunately
for
Mr.

,
another
branch
of
the
USDA
,
the
Agricultural
Marketing
Service
,
was
in
charge
of
eggs
.
<END>
<START>
The
egg
producers
also
lobbied
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
.
<END>
<START>
But
the
FDA
in
a
1985
letter
to
the
United
Egg
Producers
said
that
there
was
``
little
likelihood
''
of
a
health
problem
as
long
as
instructions
were
followed
.
<END>
<START>
So
the
producers
went
to
Capitol
Hill

where
a
congressman
from
Georgia
introduced
a
measure
to
ban
centrifugal
egg-breaking
machines

<END>
<START>
Mr.
Maynard
,
whose
company
at
the
time
was
based
in
Santa
Ana

Calif.

enlisted
his
local
congressman

and
the
battle
was
joined

<END>
<START>
Mr.

forces
finally
defeated
the
measure
,
though
it
took
a
vote
on

floor

the
House
of
Representatives
to
do
it

<END>
<START>
Even
then
,
opponents
managed

get

examine
what
one
congressman
called

``
unscrupulous
''
method
for
breaking
eggs

<END>
<START>
Foiled
in
their
effort
to
get

national
ban

the
egg

turned

So

New

New

Nebraska

suit

Mr.

only
added

The

dismissed

fees

The
solution

at
least
for
some
investors

may
be
a
hedging
technique
that

well
known
to
players
in
the
stock-options
market
.
<END>
<START>
Called
a
``
married
put
,
''
the
technique
is
carried
out
by
purchasing
a
stock
and
simultaneously
buying
a
put
option
on
that
stock
.
<END>
<START>
It
's
like
``
fire
insurance
,
''
says
Harrison
Roth
,
the
senior
options
strategist
at
Cowen
&
Co
.
<END>
<START>
But
most
investment
advisers
do
n't
recommend
using
married
puts
all
the
time
.
<END>
<START>
That
's
because
the
cost
of
buying
put
options
eats
into
an
investor
's
profit
when
stock
prices
rise
.
<END>
<START>
``
This
is
the
type
of
fire
insurance
you
only
buy
when
the
nearby
woods
are
on
fire
,
''
says
Mr.
Roth
.
<END>
<START>
``
You
always
want
your
house
insured
,
but
you
do
n't
always
feel
the
need

your
investments
to
be
insured
.
''
<END>
<START>
In
addition
to
hedging
new
stock
purchases
,
the
married-put
technique
can
be
used
to
protect
stocks
that
an
investor
already
owns
.
<END>
<START>
In
either
case
,
the
investor
faces
three
possible
outcomes
:
<END>
<START>
--
If
the
stock
goes
up
in
price
between
now
and
the
put
's
expiration
date
,
the
put
will
probably
expire
worthless
.
<END>
<START>
The
investor
will
be
out
the
cost
of
the
put
,
which
is
called
the
``
premium
,
''
and
this
loss
will
reduce
the
stock-market
profit
.
<END>
<START>
The
worst-case
scenario
would
be
if
the
put
expires
worthless
.
<END>
<START>
--
If
the
price
of
the
stock
declines
,
the
put
will
increase
in
value
.
<END>
<START>
The
put
establishes
a
minimum
selling
price
for
the
stock
during
its
life
.
<END>
<START>
When
a
stock
falls
below
the
put
's
strike
price
,
the
investor
simply
sells
the
stock
at
a
loss
and
simultaneously
sells
the
put
at
a
profit
.
<END>
<START>
Brokers
handle
such
transactions
through
the
Options
Clearing
Corp.

which
guarantees
all
option
trades
.
<END>
<START>
The
accompanying
table
shows
how
this
strategy
would
work
for
three
stocks
.
<END>
<START>
Though
not
reflected
in
the
table
,
an
investor
should
know
that
the
cost
of
the
option
insurance
can
be
partially
offset
by
any
dividends
that
the
stock
pays
.
<END>
<START>
In
this
case
,
the
investor
's
risk
would
n't
exceed
3.6
%
of
the
total
investment
.
<END>
<START>
To
simplify
the
calculations
,
commissions
on
the
option
and
underlying
stock
are
n't
included
in
the
table
.
<END>
<START>
There
are
more
than
650
stocks
on
which
options
may
be
bought
and
sold
,
including
some
over-the-counter
stocks
.
<END>
<START>
But
some
investors
might
prefer
a
simpler
strategy
then
hedging
their
individual
holdings
.
<END>
<START>
They
can
do
this
by
purchasing
``
index
puts
,
''
which
are
simply
put
options
on
indexes
that
match
broad
baskets
of
stocks
.
<END>
<START>
For
instance
,
the
most
popular
index
option
is
the
S&P
100
option
,
commonly
called
the
OEX
.
<END>
<START>
It
is
based
on
the
stocks
that
make
up
Standard
&
Poor
's
100-stock
index
.
<END>
<START>
Unlike
options
on
individual
issues
,
index
options
are
settled
only
in
cash
,
and
no
stock
is
ever
tendered
.
<END>
<START>
But
while
index
options
are
convenient
,
they
have
several
disadvantages
.
<END>
<START>
For
one
thing
,
an
investor
's
portfolio
might
not
closely
match
the
S&P
100
.
<END>
<START>
As
a
result
,
the
OEX
insurance
may
or
may
not
fully
protect
an
investor
's
holdings
in
the
event
of
a
market
decline
.
<END>
<START>
In
addition
,
OEX
options
were
suspended
from
trading
last
Friday
afternoon
,
after
the
stock-market
sell-off
got
under
way
and
trading
in
the
S&P-500
futures
contract
was
halted
.
<END>
<START>
So
an
investor
who
wanted
to
realize
a
profit
on
OEX
puts
after
the
trading
suspension
would
have
been
out
of
luck
.
<END>
<START>
On
the
other
hand
,
only
a
handful
of
individual
issues
were
suspended
from
trading
on
Friday
.
<END>
<START>
Normally
,
once
the
underlying
investment
is
suspended
from
trading
,
the
options
on
those
investments
also
do
n't
trade
.
<END>
<START>
Ultimately
,
whether
the
insurance
provided
by
purchasing
puts
is
worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
the
options
.
<END>
<START>
That
cost
rises
in
times
of
high
market
volatility
.
<END>
<START>
But
it
still
might
be
cheaper
than
taking
a
major
hit
.
<END>
<START>
The
protection
from
using
married
puts
is
clearly
superior
to
that
afforded
by
another
options
strategy
some
investors
consider
using
during
troubled
times
:
selling
call
options
on
stocks
the
investor
owns
.
<END>
<START>
A
call
option
is
similar
to
a
put
,
except
that
it
gives
its
owner
the
right
to
buy
shares
at
a
stated
price
until
expiration
.
<END>
<START>
Selling
a
call
option
gives
an
investor
a
small
buffer
against
a
stock-market
decline
.
<END>
<START>
That
's
because
it
reduces
the
cost
of
the
stock
by
the
amount
of
premium
received
from
the
sale
of
the
call
.
<END>
<START>
But
if
the
price
of
the
stock
rises
above
the
strike
price
of
the
option
,
the
stock
is
almost
certain
to
be
called
away
.
<END>
<START>
And
in
that
case
,
the
investor
misses
out
on
any
major
upside
gain
.
<END>
<START>
These
calculations
exclude
the
effect
of
commissions
paid
and
dividends
received
from
the
stock
.

All
prices
are
as

On
Oct.
14
of

the
announcement

In

the

the

Commerce
Secretary
Robert

called
the
worsening
trade
figures
``
disappointing
after
two
very

<END>
<START>
But
the
figures
reinforced
the
view
of
many
private
analysts
that
the
improvement
in
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
has
run
out
of
steam
.
<END>
<START>
Exports
declined
for
the

slipping
0.2

the
Commerce

Not
only
was
August

deficit
far
worse

the

substantially

Many
economists
contend
that
deep
cuts
in
the
U.S.
budget
deficit
are
needed
before
further
trade
improvement
can
occur
.
<END>
<START>
That
's
because
the
budget
deficit
feeds
an
enormous
appetite
in
this
country

both
foreign
goods

foreign
capital

overwhelming
the
nation

capacity

export

August

Mr.

His

introduced
about

aimed
primarily
at
university
computer
users

sports
snazzy
graphics
,
digital
sound
,
built-in
networking
and
a
sleek
black
design
.
<END>
<START>
But
the
computer
was
proving
a
hard
sell
because
of
its
high
price
,
a
lack
of
software
and
an
optical
data-storage
device
that
was
too
slow
.
<END>
<START>
The
machine
began
shipping
at

<START>
The

However
,
most
universities
that
have

say
they
are
buying
small
numbers

evaluation
purposes

<END>
<START>
Universities
can
now
buy
a
Next

without

optical
storage
device
for

Commercial

can

Calif.
,
for
roughly
$

<END>
<START>
Mr.
Jobs
said
the
changes
were
prompted
by
requests
from
customers
who
are
frustrated
with
the
performance
of
the
optical
device
,
which
is
n't
offered
as
standard
equipment
by
any
rivals

<END>
<START>
Another
factor
was
that
customers
were
asking
,
``
Why
do
n't
you
give
us
a
cheaper
system

Mr.
Jobs
said
at
a
conference
on
university
computing
here

<END>
<START>
Optical-storage
devices
can
handle
very

make
it
far
easier

edit
film
clips

audio
recordings
with
a
computer

But
the
technology
,

is
far
slower

``
We

He
said
that
the
next
generation
of
optical
drives
will
be
as
fast

hard
drives

he
depends
on
outside
suppliers
for
the
devices

it

Universities
,
however

say
Next

prices
must
go
even
lower

purchase

<END>
<START>
Broad
acceptance
of
Next
's
computer
also
is
hindered
by
difficulty

distributing
software

Most

is

reads

The

there
a

Did
Mr.

Finally

all
these

central
issue

Who
is

who
should
be
making
the
criminal
law
here
?
<END>
<START>
It
is
not
my
contention
that
either
Mr.
Chestman
or
Mr.
Freeman
was
an
innocent
victim
of
prosecutorial
overzealousness

<END>
<START>
Arguably
,
both
were
on
notice
that
their
behavior
was
at
least
risky

<END>
<START>
But
even
if
they
behaved
recklessly
,
reasons
still
exist
to
fear
and
resist
this
steady
process

case-by-case
judicial
extension
of
the
law
of
insider
trading

Courts

judicial
examination

When
only
civil

avoidance

overgeneralization

<END>
<START>
Still
,
case-by-case
retrospective
decision
making
of
this

is
vulnerable

the
tunnel
vision

a
fixation
on
ad

-LRB-

usually
sleazy
-RRB-
examples

<END>
<START>
Traders
are
likely

oppose
such
restrictions

dual

make
money

slower
markets

there

a
shortage
of
customer
orders

<START>
The
exchanges
contend
that
dual
trading
improves
liquidity
in

traders
can
buy
or
sell
even
when
they
do
n't
have
a
customer
order
in
hand

liquidity

contracts

expiration

Dictaphone
Corp.
was
caught
off
guard
in
1974
when
its
main
competitor
,
Lanier
Office
Products
of
Japan
,
introduced
a
microcassette
dictation
recorder
half
the
size
of
standard
cassette
devices
.
<END>
<START>
Blocked
by
patent
protection
from
following
suit
,
Dictaphone
decided
to
go
a
step
further
and
cut
the
cassette
in
half
again
--
down
to
the
length
of
a
paperclip
.
<END>
<START>
By
1979
,
designers

engineers
at
Dictaphone
,
a
Pitney
Bowes
subsidiary

had
produced
a
working
model
of
a
``
picocassette
''
recorder
.
<END>
<START>
By
1982
,
however
,
the
patent
status
of
the
Lanier
microcassette
had
changed
,
permitting
Dictaphone
to
develop
its
own
competitive
micro
system
,
which
it
did
.
<END>
<START>
Marketing
and
sales
departments
then
urged
abandonment
of
the
pico
project

<END>
<START>
But
others
said
pico
should
proceed
.
<END>
<START>
Both
were
right
.
<END>
<START>
Dictaphone
went
ahead
and
introduced
the
pico
in
1985
,
but
it
has
n't
sold
well
.
<END>
<START>
To
date
,
says
Emil
Jachmann
,
a
Dictaphone
vice
president
,
it
has
``
broken

Nevertheless

the
device
has
been
successful

Dictaphone

it

we
invent
