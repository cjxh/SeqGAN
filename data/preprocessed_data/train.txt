part

sooner
or
later
,
most
of
us
have
to
think
about
life
insurance
,
just
as
we
often
have
to
think
about
having
root-canal
work
.
<END>
<START>
and
my
time
has
come
.
<END>
<START>
i
'm
33
,
married
,
no
children
,
and
employed
in
writing
stories
like
this
one
.
<END>
<START>
in
times
past
,
life-insurance
salesmen
targeted
heads
of
household
,
meaning
men
,
but
ours
is
a
two-income
family
and
accustomed
to
it
.
<END>
<START>
what
to
do
?
<END>
<START>
first
,
generalize
.
<END>
<START>
if
all
you
want
is
death-benefit
coverage
,
pure
insurance
--
a
term
policy
--
gives
you
maximum
bang
for
your
buck
,
within
limits
.
<END>
<START>
it
's
much
cheaper
than
permanent
insurance
bought
at
the
same
age
.
<END>
<START>
but
``
term
''
means
just
that
;
the
policy
is
written
for
a
specific
time
period
only
and
must
be
renewed
when
it
expires
.
<END>
<START>
even
if
you
're
healthy
and
can
renew
,
your
premium
will
go
up
sharply
because
you
're
that
much
older
.
<END>
<START>
so
term
insurance
may
not
be
as
cheap
as
it
looks
.
<END>
<START>
there
are
all
sorts
of
variations
on
term
insurance
:
policies
structured
to
pay
off
your
mortgage
debt
,
term
riders
tacked
on
to
permanent
insurance
,
and
many
others
.
<END>
<START>
upon
examination
,
however
,
i
wondered
whether
the
plan
made
a
lot
of
sense
.
<END>
<START>
sounds
great
--
or
does
it
?
<END>
<START>
first
,
if
i
canceled
,
i
'd
have
no
more
insurance
,
a
not
insignificant
consideration
.
<END>
<START>
that
would
be
all
right
with
amex
,
which
could
then
lock
in
its
investment
profit
,
but
it
does
n't
add
up
to
a
``
smart
money
''
move
for
me
.
<END>
<START>
which
goes
to
show
that
the
first
law
applies
in
insurance
as
in
anything
else
:
there
is
no
free
lunch
,
there
is
only
marketing
.
<END>
<START>
and
the
second
law
,
unique
to
insurance
?
<END>
<START>
if
i
die
early
,
i
win
--
a
hollow
victory
,
since
i
ca
n't
enjoy
it
--
and
if
i
live
long
,
the
insurer
wins
.
<END>
<START>
always
.
<END>
<START>
this
is
worth
remembering
when
insurers
and
their
salesmen
try
to
sell
you
permanent
insurance
,
the
kind
that
amasses
cash
value
.
<END>
<START>
the
implication
is
that
your
permanent-insurance
policy
is
really
some
kind
of
cd
or
mutual-fund
account
with
an
added
feature
.
<END>
<START>
that
is
gilding
the
lily
.
<END>
<START>
that
's
because
you
have
to
pay
for
the
insurance
portion
of
the
policy
and
the
effort
required
to
sell
and
service
the
whole
package
.
<END>
<START>
again
,
no
free
lunch
.
<END>
<START>
so
view
permanent
insurance
for
what
it
is
--
a
compromise
between
pure
insurance
and
direct
investment
.
<END>
<START>
the
simplest
,
most
traditional
form
of
permanent
insurance
is
the
straight
whole
life
policy
.
<END>
<START>
congress
closed
this
loophole
last
year
,
or
thought
it
did
.
<END>
<START>
but
the
percentage
of
your
cash
reserve
that
you
can
borrow
tax-free
is
very
small
.
<END>
<START>
i
'm
not
prepared
in
any
case
to
put
that
much
money
into
a
policy
immediately
,
so
i
look
into
the
broad
category
called
universal
life
.
<END>
<START>
hugely
popular
,
it
is
far
more
flexible
than
straight
whole
life
.
<END>
<START>
projecting
the
latter
over
several
decades
,
i
find
my
cash
buildup
is
impressive
--
but
can
any
high
interest
rate
prevail
for
that
long
?
<END>
<START>
not
likely
,
i
think
.
<END>
<START>
also
,
some
policy
illustrations
assume
that
mortality
costs
will
decline
or
that
i
will
get
some
sort
of
dividend
bonus
after
the
10th
year
.
<END>
<START>
these
are
not
certain
,
either
.
<END>
<START>
there
are
seemingly
endless
twists
to
universal
life
,
and
it
pays
to
ask
questions
about
all
of
them
.
<END>
<START>
i
call
her
agent
,
david
dominici
.
<END>
<START>
if
interest
rates
plunge
,
the
insurer
may
be
knocking
on
my
door
,
asking
for
steeper
premium
payments
to
maintain
the
same
amount
of
protection
.
<END>
<START>
i
do
n't
like
the
sound
of
that
.
<END>
<START>
some
insurers
have
also
started
offering
``
persistency
bonuses
,
''
such
as
extra
dividends
or
a
marginally
higher
interest
yield
,
if
the
policy
is
maintained
for
10
years
.
<END>
<START>
but
glenn
daily
,
a
new
york-based
financial
consultant
,
warns
that
many
of
these
bonuses
are
``
just
fantasies

''
because
most
are
n't
guaranteed
by
the
companies
.
<END>
<START>
and
the
feature
is
so
new
,
he
adds
,
that
no
insurer
has
yet
established
a
track
record
for
actually
making
such
payments
.
<END>
<START>
so-called
living-benefits
provisions
also
merit
a
close
inspection
.
<END>

also

financial
planners
advising

insurance
say
that
to
their
knowledge
there
has

been

ruling
exempting
these
advance
payments

taxes

to

--
if

now

the
put
's

date

the
put
will
probably
expire

<END>
<START>
the
investor
will
be
out
the
cost
of
the
put

which
is
called
the
``
premium

''
and
this
loss
will
reduce

the
worst-case
scenario

put

worthless

the
stock
declines

the
put
will
increase
in
value

<END>
<START>
the
put
establishes
a
minimum
selling
price
for
the
stock
during
its
life
.
<END>
<START>
when
a
stock
falls
below
the
put
's
strike
price

the

<END>
<START>
though
not
reflected

an
investor
should
know
that
the
cost
of
the
option
insurance
can
be
partially
offset
by
any
dividends
that
the
stock
pays
.
<END>
<START>
in
this
case

the
investor
's
risk
would
n't
exceed

%

to
simplify
the
calculations

commissions

stocks

<END>
<START>
but
some
investors
might
prefer
a
simpler
strategy
then
hedging
their
individual
holdings
.
<END>
<START>
they
can
do
this
by
purchasing
``
index
puts
,
''
which
are
simply
put
options
on
indexes
that
match
broad
baskets
of
stocks
.
<END>
<START>
for
instance
,
the
most
popular
index
option
is
the
s&p
100
option
,
commonly
called
the
oex
.
<END>
<START>
it
is
based
on
the
stocks
that
make
up
standard
&
poor
's
100-stock
index
.
<END>
<START>
unlike
options
on
individual
issues
,
index
options
are
settled
only

no
stock
is
ever
tendered

<END>
<START>
but
while
index
options
are
convenient
,
they
have
several
disadvantages
.
<END>
<START>
for
one
thing
,
an
investor
's
portfolio
might
not
closely
match
the
s&p
100
.
<END>
<START>
as
a
result
,
the
oex
insurance
may
or
may
not
fully
protect
an
investor
's
holdings
in
the
event
of
a
market
decline
.
<END>
<START>
in
addition
,
oex
options
were
suspended
from
trading
last
friday
afternoon
,
after
the
stock-market
sell-off
got
under
way
and
trading
in
the
s&p-500
futures
contract
was
halted
.
<END>
<START>
so
an
investor
who
wanted
to
realize
a
profit
on
oex
puts
after
the
trading
suspension
would
have
been
out
of
luck
.
<END>
<START>
on
the
other
hand
,
only
a
handful
of
individual
issues
were
suspended
from
trading
on
friday
.
<END>
<START>
normally
,
once
the
underlying
investment
is
suspended
from
trading
,
the
options
on
those
investments
also
do
n't
trade
.
<END>
<START>
ultimately
,
whether
the
insurance
provided
by
purchasing
puts
is
worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
the
options
.
<END>
<START>
that
cost
rises
in
times
of
high
market
volatility
.
<END>
<START>
but
it
still
might
be
cheaper
than
taking
a
major
hit
.
<END>
<START>
the
protection
from
using
married
puts
is
clearly
superior
to
that
afforded
by
another
options
strategy
some
investors
consider
using
during
troubled
times
:
selling
call
options
on
stocks
the
investor
owns
.
<END>
<START>
a
call
option
is
similar
to
a
put
,
except
that
it
gives
its
owner
the
right
to
buy
shares
at
a
stated
price
until
expiration
.
<END>
<START>
selling
a
call
option
gives
an
investor
a
small
buffer
against
a
stock-market
decline
.
<END>
<START>
that
's
because
it
reduces
the
cost
of
the
stock
by
the
amount
of
premium
received
from
the
sale
of
the
call
.
<END>
<START>
but
if
the
price
of
the
stock
rises
above
the
strike
price
of
the
option
,
the
stock
is
almost
certain
to
be
called
away
.
<END>
<START>
and
in
that
case
,
the
investor
misses
out
on
any
major
upside
gain
.
<END>

these
calculations
exclude
the
effect

commissions
paid

the
